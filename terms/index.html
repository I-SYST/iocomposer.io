    <div class="container">
        <div class="disclaimer">
            <strong>Note:</strong> This document should be reviewed by qualified legal counsel before production use.
        </div>

        <div class="provider-info">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Provider:</strong> I-SYST Inc. (Québec, Canada) ("I-SYST", "we", "us")</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:info@i-syst.com">info@i-syst.com</a></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Address:</strong> 50 de Lauzon, Boucherville, Quebec, Canada J4B 1E6</p>
        </div>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of (a) the IOcomposer cloud services (the "Service") and (b) the IOcomposer desktop software, including the Eclipse plugin and related components (the "Desktop App"). The Service and Desktop App are collectively "IOcomposer".</p>

        <p>By creating an account, signing in, installing, or using IOcomposer, you agree to these Terms. If you are using IOcomposer on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization, and "you" means that organization.</p>

        <h2>1) Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account:</strong> Your user account for accessing the Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> Text, prompts, inputs, source snippets, project metadata, and other information you provide to IOcomposer to generate outputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Output:</strong> Responses, suggestions, patches, or code generated by IOcomposer.</li>
            <li><strong>Beta:</strong> A pre-release access period of IOcomposer that may include expanded access or higher limits. Features and limits may change at any time. Beta access is a form of Trial.</li>
            <li><strong>Trial:</strong> A time-limited access period that may provide features or limits different from the free plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Unlimited:</strong> If we describe a plan or feature as "unlimited," it means there is no pre-set hard cap intended for normal use, but usage remains subject to fair use, abuse prevention, rate limiting, and technical and third‑party provider constraints.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Services we do not control, including identity, hosting, payments, and AI model providers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) Eligibility and Account Security</h2>
        <p>You must be legally able to enter into these Terms. You agree to provide accurate account information and to maintain the confidentiality of your authentication credentials. You are responsible for all activity under your Account.</p>

        <h2>3) License to Use the Desktop App</h2>
        <p>Subject to these Terms, I-SYST grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the Desktop App for your internal use.</p>
        <p><strong>Restrictions.</strong> You may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code except to the extent permitted by law;</li>
            <li>circumvent, disable, or interfere with security, rate limits, or access controls;</li>
            <li>resell, lease, or provide IOcomposer on a service bureau basis, except with our written permission.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Your Content and Output</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Ownership</h3>
        <p>As between you and I-SYST, you retain ownership of your Content. Subject to applicable law, I-SYST retains ownership of IOcomposer, including the Service and Desktop App.</p>
        
        <h3>4.2 License to Process Content</h3>
        <p>You grant I-SYST a limited license to process your Content solely to provide and secure IOcomposer (for example: to generate Output, enforce usage limits, prevent abuse, and maintain reliability). This license is limited to the duration and scope required to perform the Service as described in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>We process Content transiently to generate Output. We do not store prompts, source code, or AI outputs on our servers, except for non-content usage metadata (counts, timestamps, plan enforcement signals) as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h3>4.3 Output</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for reviewing and testing Output before using it in production. <strong>Output is AI-generated and may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, incomplete implementations, or code that infringes third-party rights.</strong> Output may be incorrect, insecure, or unsuitable for your use case.</p>
        <p>Subject to these Terms and any applicable third‑party rights, you may use Output for any lawful purpose, including commercial use. To the extent I-SYST has any rights in Output, we grant you a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, and otherwise exploit the Output.</p>
        <p><strong>No professional advice.</strong> Output is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional advice (engineering, safety, regulatory, legal, etc.).</p>

        <h2>5) Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p><strong>Do not submit passwords, private keys, API keys, or other secrets to IOcomposer.</strong> You are responsible for removing sensitive data from Content.</p>
        <p>You agree not to use IOcomposer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>for unlawful, harmful, or abusive activity;</li>
            <li>to generate or distribute malware, exploit code, or instructions for wrongdoing;</li>
            <li>to harass, threaten, or violate the rights of others;</li>
            <li>to attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems or data;</li>
            <li><strong>in safety-critical systems, medical devices, or life-support systems without independent verification and validation;</strong></li>
            <li>to violate third-party terms (including SDK licenses) or applicable export controls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must comply with the terms, policies, and acceptable use requirements of any Third‑Party Services used by IOcomposer (including AI model providers). You may not use IOcomposer in a manner that would cause I‑SYST or the Third‑Party Service provider to violate applicable law or provider policies.</p>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate Accounts that violate this section.</p>

        <h2>6) Service Plans, Billing, and Usage Limits</h2>
        
        <h3>6.1 Subscription Tiers</h3>
        <p>IOcomposer offers multiple subscription tiers (e.g., Free, Advanced, Pro). The specific features, message allowances, intelligence models, and file upload limits for each tier are described on our pricing page and at the point of checkout.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Access is limited to "Fast" or "Standard" intelligence models. We reserve the right to throttle or deprioritize Free tier traffic during periods of high demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Paid Tiers (Advanced &amp; Pro):</strong> Paid plans include access to higher-capability models and larger context windows.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6.2 The "Neural Router" and Adaptive Intelligence</h3>
        <p>The Advanced plan utilizes our proprietary "Neural Router" (or "Adaptive Intelligence") technology. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Automated Selection:</strong> The Service automatically analyzes your prompt complexity and routes it to the most suitable AI model (e.g., a "Fast" model for simple queries or a "High-Reasoning" model for complex tasks) to optimize performance and quota usage.</li>
            <li><strong>No Guarantee of Specific Model:</strong> Unless you are on a plan that explicitly guarantees "Priority Access" or "Max Intelligence" for every query (e.g., <strong>Pro</strong>), the Service does not guarantee which specific underlying model (e.g., GPT-5.2 vs. GPT-5.2-mini) will generate a specific response.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>6.3 Usage Quotas and "High-Complexity" Deductions</h3>
        <p>Your plan includes a monthly allowance of "Messages" or "Credits." To maintain fair access and sustainable pricing, we calculate usage based on computational load:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard Queries:</strong> Typical text-based interactions count as 1 Message.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Complexity Queries:</strong> Requests involving large file attachments (e.g., PDFs >5MB), extensive codebases, or extremely long conversation histories require significantly more processing power. These interactions may deduct multiple units (e.g., 3x or 5x) from your monthly allowance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Service interface will make reasonable efforts to display usage or remaining quota. Unused allowances typically do not roll over to the next billing cycle unless explicitly stated in your plan description.</p>
        
        <h3>6.4 Preview or Beta Access</h3>
        <p>We may offer Preview or Beta access that includes expanded access or higher limits. Those features are provided "as-is" and may be revoked or modified at any time without notice.</p>
        
        <h3>6.5 Billing and Cancellation (Stripe)</h3>
        <p>If you purchase a paid plan, payments are processed by Stripe. You authorize recurring charges per the plan you select. You may cancel at any time via your account settings; cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. Refunds are not provided except where required by law.</p>
        
        <h3>6.6 Taxes</h3>
        <p>Prices may be exclusive of applicable taxes unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for applicable taxes except where we are required by law to collect them.</p>
        
        <h3>6.7 No Refunds</h3>
        <p>Except where required by law, fees are non-refundable.</p>
        
        <h3>6.8 Usage Monitoring</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to monitor usage patterns (on a metadata level) and may throttle, suspend, or terminate accounts that we determine, in our sole discretion, are exceeding reasonable human usage limits or abusing the Service.</p>

        <h2>7) Service Availability, Changes, and Support</h2>
        <p>IOcomposer is provided on an "as available" basis. We may change or discontinue features, limits, or availability. For Beta and MVP phases, support is provided on a best-effort basis via the contact method above.</p>

        <h2>8) Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>IOcomposer relies on Third-Party Services, including AI model providers (such as Anthropic and OpenAI), identity providers, and payment processors. These services include:</p>
        <p><strong>Third-party SDK downloads.</strong> IOcomposer does not bundle vendor SDKs in the product distribution. As a convenience, the installer may download third-party SDKs and related components <strong>directly from their official upstream repositories</strong> and place them into a separate folder named <code>external/</code> on your machine. These SDKs remain subject to their own licenses and terms. IOcomposer does not grant any rights to third-party SDKs, and you are responsible for complying with applicable upstream license terms when you use them.</p>
        <p>By enabling third-party SDK downloads in the installer, you authorize IOcomposer to fetch and install those components into <code>external/</code> under their respective licenses.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supabase</strong> for authentication and database</li>
            <li><strong>Stripe</strong> for billing</li>
            <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> for AI model services</li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> for AI model services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Third-Party Services are subject to their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for Third-Party Services outside our control.</p>

        <h2>9) Suspension and Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you breach these Terms;</li>
            <li>your use creates risk or legal exposure for us or others;</li>
            <li>we are required to do so by law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may stop using IOcomposer at any time. Upon termination, your license to the Desktop App ends.</p>

        <h2>10) Disclaimers</h2>
        <p><strong>IOcomposer is provided "as is" and "as available."</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, I-SYST disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

        <h2>11) Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, I-SYST will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenues, data, or goodwill.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, I-SYST's total liability for all claims relating to IOcomposer will not exceed the amounts you paid to I-SYST for IOcomposer in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim (or CAD $100 if you have not paid).</p>

        <h2>12) Indemnity</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless I-SYST from claims arising out of your misuse of IOcomposer or violation of these Terms, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>13) Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Québec and the applicable federal laws of Canada, without regard to conflict of laws rules. Courts located in Québec will have exclusive jurisdiction, unless prohibited by law.</p>
        <p><strong>Consumer rights.</strong> If you are a consumer, you may have mandatory rights under the laws of your jurisdiction. Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit rights that cannot be excluded by applicable law.</p>

        <h2>14) Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated version and update the effective date. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>
